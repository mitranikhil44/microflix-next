  "introduction": "Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are integrated systems of computational elements and physical processes, tightly coupled through feedback loops.",
  "details": "CPS combine hardware, software, sensors, and actuators to monitor and control physical processes in real-time. They find applications in autonomous vehicles, smart grids, and healthcare systems. Learning about cyber-physical systems involves understanding control theory, real-time computing, and security challenges in CPS deployment.",
