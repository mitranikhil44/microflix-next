  "introduction": "Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, performance, and concurrency. It is designed to prevent common programming errors like null pointer dereferences and data races.",
  "details": "Rust uses a strict ownership model and a powerful borrow checker to ensure memory safety and prevent data races. It provides low-level control like C or C++, but with better safety guarantees. Learning Rust involves understanding its ownership model, borrowing rules, and writing concurrent and safe code.",
