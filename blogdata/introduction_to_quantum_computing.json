  "introduction": "Quantum computing is an emerging field of study that uses principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations with the potential to solve complex problems much faster than classical computers.",
  "details": "Quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits to represent and process information. They have the ability to perform parallel computations and exploit quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement. Learning about quantum computing involves understanding quantum gates, quantum algorithms, and quantum information theory.",
